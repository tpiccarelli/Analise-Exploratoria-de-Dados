Coursera: Exploratory Data Analysis

Principles of Analytic Graphics:
    Principle 1: Show comparisons
        Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis: "Compared to What?"
        
    Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
    
    Principle 3: Show multivariate data
    
    Principle 4: Integration of evidence
        Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
    
    Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
        A data graphic should tell a complete story
    
    Principle 6: Content is king
        Analytical  presentations  ultimately  stand  or  fall  depending  on  the  quality,  relevance,  and integrity of their content
        
Simple Summaries of Data:
    One dimension
        Five-number summary (min, mean, median, max, 1st & 3rd qt)
            summary()
        Boxplots
            boxplot()
        Histograms
            hist()
            rug()
        Density plot
            
        Barplot
            table()
        
        Overlaying Features
            regression line: abline()
            
    Two dimensions
        Multiple/overlayed 1-D plots (Lattice/ggplot2)
        Scatterplots: with(..., plot())
        Smooth scatterplots
    
    Plotting systems
        Base
            with(..., plot())
            functions to add/modify: text, lines, points, axis
            *** base graphics parameters: ?par
        Lattice
            single function call: xyplot(), bwplot(), etc
            useful for conditioning plots: how y changes with x across levels of z
            margins/spacing set automatically
        ggplot2
            mixes elements of Base and Lattice
            qplot()
    
    Base plotting system
        packages:
            graphics: plot(), hist(), boxplot()
            grDevices
            lattice: xyplot(), bwplot(), levelplot()
            grid: bases's independent graphing system
